# Developing Shellby

How to build Shellby, how he drives Claude Code, the test and maintenance scripts, and a map of the code. For the contribution guidelines, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md); for the short version with a diagram, see [How it works](../README.md#how-it-works).

## How Shellby drives Claude Code

Shellby doesn't talk to any AI API itself. Each conversation is one long-lived Claude Code process:

```
claude -p --input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json --verbose
       --permission-prompt-tool stdio --replay-user-messages --permission-mode <mode>
       --allow-dangerously-skip-permissions [--resume <id>]
```

- **Tasks** go in as JSON user messages on stdin. One process holds the whole conversation, so follow-ups keep context.
- **Permission prompts** come out as `control_request { subtype: "can_use_tool" }` and Shellby answers with `allow` / `deny` (plus the suggested rules for "Always allow"). This is the same host protocol the Claude Agent SDK uses.
- **Stop** sends an `interrupt` control request, and falls back to killing the process tree if the CLI doesn't wind down.
- **Mode changes** mid-conversation send `set_permission_mode`.
- **Subagents** come through as `task_started` / `task_progress` / `task_notification` system events. Their messages carry `parent_tool_use_id`, the Agent call that spawned them, and their permission prompts carry `agent_id`, which equals the `task_id`. That's all it takes to route every event, prompt and helper crab to the right lane.
- **Background commands and watches** (`Bash { run_in_background }`, `Monitor`) come through as the same `task_*` events with `task_type: "local_bash"` (helpers are `local_agent`), and only `task_started` says the type, so later events are known by their task id (jobs.js). A command's exit code is only in `task_notification`'s summary. Stop sends a `stop_task` control request, as Claude Code's own TaskStop does. A helper sent another message (`SendMessage`) starts again under that call's id while its messages keep the first Agent call's.
- **Claude's own to-do list** is its `TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` calls (`TodoWrite` in older versions); the new to-do's id comes back in `TaskCreate`'s result (shared/todos.js).
- **Newer flags** (`session.js` `OPTIONAL_FLAGS`: `--include-partial-messages`, `--forward-subagent-text`, `--fallback-model`, `--name`, `--agent`, `--safe-mode`, `--chrome`) are passed only when the installed CLI's `--help` lists them (`claude/cli.js` `helpFlags`, read with the status check), and never over ssh, where the version isn't known. An older CLI stops at a flag it doesn't know, so without this check every turn would fail.
- **The reply as it's written** comes as `stream_event` `content_block_delta` / `text_delta` events. The session batches them into `partial` items every 50 ms. They reach the panel but are never saved, and the panel swaps them for the finished `text` item. **Prompt suggestions** (`promptSuggestions: true` in `initialize`) arrive after a turn as `prompt_suggestion` events and are never saved either. Claude Code only sends them when a server-side switch allows it. As of 2.1.296 the dev PC's account got none, even with `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_PROMPT_SUGGESTION` set. **A helper's words** (`--forward-subagent-text`) are assistant events with `parent_tool_use_id`. They show in its lane, and their first line goes in its crab's bubble.
- **`/goal`** has no event of its own: Claude Code answers with a `<synthetic>`-model reply, `Goal set: …` or `Goal cleared: …` (`stream.js` `goalOf`), and the panel pins the goal from that.
- **Cloud sessions** (`--teleport`, `--cloud`, `--from-pr`) open in a terminal through `handoff.js` `cloudArgs`, which allows a fixed set of arguments only. A cloud session's description goes only to PowerShell, as a single-quoted literal, never to cmd.
- **Cloud routines** (`/schedule`) are listed and run by a one-off `claude -p` that may only call Claude Code's RemoteTrigger tool (Haiku, no MCP servers, no settings, a 5¢ cap); Shellby reads the tool's own result out of the stream (cloud-routines.js). The ultra review (`/code-review ultra`) opens in a terminal, where Claude Code's launch dialog asks first.
- **The toolbox** merges the skills, agents, commands and MCP servers reported in Claude Code's `init` event with a scan of `~/.claude` and the project's `.claude/`. A file watcher on those folders is how Shellby notices new tricks.
- **Billing safety:** Shellby never sees your Claude sign-in. You log in to the official, unmodified Claude Code CLI yourself, and Shellby only reads `claude auth status` to show which account and plan it's on. Claude Code gets the environment as it is on your PC, so if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` or a Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry switch is set, Settings warns that it may bill that instead. **Always use my Claude plan** leaves them all out. Usage counts against your plan's normal limits, exactly as if you'd typed the task into a terminal.

**Staying on the desktop layer:** the critter window is made an *owned window* of the shell's desktop host (the `Progman`/`WorkerW` window that contains `SHELLDLL_DefView`), via [koffi](https://koffi.dev) FFI calls into `user32.dll`. Owned windows share their owner's z-order band, so he sits above your wallpaper and icons and below every app. A `TaskbarCreated` hook re-pins him when Explorer restarts, and a slow watchdog covers anything else.

## Build and run

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/x-salmon/shellby
cd shellby
npm install
node node_modules/electron/install.js   # only if npm skipped the Electron download
npm start
```

### Crash reports

Crash reports go to Sentry only from builds with a DSN: `DSN` in `src/main/crash-report.js` for releases, and `SHELLBY_SENTRY_DSN` for a dev run (point it at a separate Sentry project, or at a local server that records what arrives). With neither, Sentry is never loaded and the **Crash reports** row in Settings stays hidden. To see the "closed unexpectedly" path, end a run from Task Manager and start it again. The run marker is `logs\running.json` in the profile. A conversation mid-turn has a mark of its own, `turnOpen` on its entry in `sessions\index.json`: written the moment the turn starts, cleared when it ends. The next start turns any left behind into a "Cut off" note with a Carry on button (`History.takeCutOff`, from wiring/profile.js). End a run from Task Manager while a `wait 30000` turn runs on the fake CLI to see it.

## Scripts

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm start` | Run in development |
| `npm run dev:crab` | A dev Shellby beside your installed one: its own profile (`%TEMP%\shellby-dev-crab`, or `SHELLBY_DEV_PROFILE`), the fake CLI, its own hook port and the dev hooks (`SHELLBY_MOTION_TEST`). `--fresh` empties the profile, `--real` uses the real Claude CLI, `--poses` walks him through every work pose (work-pose.js) and habit (voice.js `BITS`) and closes, `--loop` keeps going; with `SHELLBY_SHOTS=<folder>` it saves a PNG of each |
| `npm test` | Unit and integration tests (Node's built-in runner; a fake Claude CLI stands in for the real one). Four files at a time: the suite starts thousands of git and node processes, Windows (with antivirus watching) starts only about 30 a second however many ask, and Node's default of one file per core starved the git-heavy files past their 120 s on a many-core PC |
| `npm run commands:check` | Diffs the catalogue of Claude Code's slash commands (`src/main/cli-commands.js`) against the installed CLI; `-- --write` records the CLI's list as `test/fixtures/cli-commands.json`. See [Keeping up with Claude Code](#keeping-up-with-claude-code) |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint over main, the renderers, the tests and the scripts, each with the globals it really has (see eslint.config.mjs) |
| `npm run panel:html` | Builds `src/renderer/panel/panel.html` from the files in `src/renderer/panel/html/` (a frame plus one per screen, `<!-- @include x.html -->`). Run it after editing any of them; `-- --check` says if it's stale |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript's checker over the JSDoc in `src/preload` and `src/main`'s `ipc`, `flaky`, `remote`, `backlog`, `bugdex`, `depwatch`, `tank`, `stickers`, `usage`, `weather`, `hooks`, `claude` and `routines` (jsconfig.json), with no build step |
| `npm run packs` | Validates the built-in wardrobe packs in `src/wardrobe/` |
| `npm run packs:format` | Rewrites those packs in the house style: pivot and palette on one line, one pixel row per line |
| `npm run packs:sheet` | A contact sheet of every built-in pack worn by the crab (Python), to eyeball new art |
| `node scripts/crab-sheet.js skins\|shells\|<pack>...` | Him drawn as the app draws him (`shared/sprite.js`, ink line and all) on a dark and a light wallpaper: every skin, each shell worn, or each accessory in a pack worn. `--skin id`, `--no-ink` |
| `node scripts/finds-sheet.js [ids or sets]` | The finds' portraits beside their little art; `--forms` adds the sparkly one and the shelf's silhouette. `scripts/bugdex-sheet.js` does the same for the Bugdex |
| `npm run tricks` | Films the README's "Things to try" GIFs on the real desktop with a throwaway profile and its own Notepad. It moves windows and the cursor, so leave the mouse alone |
| `npm run e2e:ci` | The end-to-end checks that need no Claude account, no GitHub and no network, one after another. This is what CI runs, and the only automated coverage the renderer has. It sets `SHELLBY_E2E=1`, so the app ignores what else is open on your desktop (src/main/test-desktop.js). Words narrow it (`npm run e2e:ci -- queue voice`); `--shard=i/n` takes the ith of n shards that take about as long (by each check's CI time in `scripts/e2e-times.json`), which is how CI splits them across six machines. Refresh the times with `GH_TOKEN=... node scripts/e2e-times.js` when the shards drift apart. A script joins the run when its first line says what it covers: `// ci: queued messages: queue, edit, drain` |
| `node scripts/smoke-real.js` | End-to-end check against your real Claude Code install |
| `node scripts/cli-compat.js` | Checks the installed Claude Code against what Shellby relies on: flags, permission modes, effort levels and the control protocol, with no account needed. `--real` adds one tiny Haiku turn (a Write approved over the protocol) and audits every event it sends. Nightly in CI; see [Keeping up with Claude Code](#keeping-up-with-claude-code) |
| `node scripts/e2e-ui.js` | Drives the real UI over CDP: two parallel tabs, a subagent needing approval, helper crabs on the desktop |
| `node scripts/overlay-visual-test.js` | Proves the critter never paints over apps: covers it with a window, cycles every mood, and counts real screen pixels |
| `node scripts/e2e-shop.js` | The Skill Shop against your real Claude Code, read-only: plugin list, search and filters, then Install is cancelled in the confirm window, so nothing is installed |
| `node scripts/e2e-lean.js` | Lean Shell: with the fake CLI, the prompt-cache dot on the context chip (warm, then cold) and the fresh-start XP; then Toolbox → Lean against your real Claude Code, read-only: plugins with their estimates, CLAUDE.md apart from path-scoped rules, and Turn off cancelled in the confirm window, so nothing is turned off |
| `node scripts/e2e-registry.js` | One-click install from the live community registry: warm and cold, themed confirmation, every item previewed |
| `node scripts/e2e-wardrobe.js` | Real task → first trophy unlocks → desktop celebration and the celebration card → wear the Party Hat from it (isolated profile) |
| `python scripts/preview-wardrobe.py` | Contact sheet of every accessory worn by the crab, for pixel-art work |
| `node scripts/e2e-plugin.js` | A **real** `claude -p` session with `--plugin-dir ./claude-plugin` drives a dev Shellby: the crab works, then celebrates. Also checks the hook is instant when Shellby is closed (uses one tiny prompt) |
| `node scripts/e2e-outfit-code.js` | Outfit codes: read your code, undress, paste it back for the same look; locked items, a community item traced to its pack in the live gallery, a typo, the code on the crab card |
| `node scripts/e2e-vscode.js` | The editor touches, against the fake CLI: a turn's diff in colour, Side by side (remembered), Undo this part on one of two hunks and the whole Undo after it, a reply's code block coloured with Copy and a Mermaid block drawn, Ctrl+Shift+T bringing back a closed tab, a shortcut given new keys in the Ctrl+/ list (and a taken key refused), the outline opening on those keys and going to a file's diff, and Problems listing a typecheck's tsc error and sending Fix it. `E2E_SHOTS=<dir>` saves screenshots |
| `node scripts/e2e-editor.js [folder]` | An edit's permission card shows its diff with line numbers, the tool row folds open to it, a path in a reply becomes a link (checked, never clicked), Ctrl+F counts and steps through matches, Ctrl+= zooms, Ctrl+Shift+P opens the palette, and Settings → Editor says what Automatic means. Screenshots go in `[folder]` |
| `node scripts/e2e-panes.js [--shots <dir>]` | Conversations side by side and in their own windows: Split and drags up to four columns, the lines between panes resize them, each pane's own tab strip (a tab dropped on a strip, on the middle of a pane or on an edge goes where it should, a pane's × moves its tabs next door, Ctrl+Tab stays in its pane), the box moves to the pane you're in and the rest show their drafts, Alt/Ctrl+Alt+arrows move between panes and move a conversation into the next, the layout and every pane's tabs survive a restart, a tab dragged out gets a window of its own with its conversation and what was typed, and its × hands it back |
| `node scripts/e2e-notes.js` | Notes: a list per project plus a General one; adding, editing, ticking off, moving between lists and deleting, and Plan / Build / Ask each opening a task in the right folder, in the right mode, with the right prompt |
| `node scripts/e2e-native.js [folder]` | What Claude Code does by itself, made visible, with the fake CLI and a throwaway Claude config folder: its to-do list above the box ticking over, a command left running (the tray, its output, Stop, the crab's badge, done and failed), a plan with a note on one line sent back whole and then approved (the crab's "plan?"), Claude switching itself to planning, a skill's first use and what it's for, a memory written down, listed in Toolbox → Memory and forgotten, the effort and thinking beside a turn's cost, a helper messaged again (one lane, both answers, the message on the desktop, what it spent on the turn's cost line and its lane) and cloud routines on the Routines page. Screenshots go in `[folder]` |
| `node scripts/e2e-questions.js` | Claude's multiple-choice questions: a real question card, number keys, multi-select and your own words, Skip, and exactly what Claude receives |
| `node scripts/e2e-feed-cap.js` | A very long conversation stops growing the DOM: 3,600 blocks pumped through one tab, the cap holds, the tool and lane maps let go with the elements, a result for a long-trimmed tool is ignored, and replay is capped too |
| `node scripts/e2e-feed-scroll.js` | Your prompt is fully visible after sending, with the Working bar and queued messages, even when scrolled up; replies don't yank you out of history |
| `node scripts/e2e-streaks.js` | Streaks and nudges with a real throwaway git repo (last commit 6 days ago): the streak starts, the repo root is found from a subfolder, the nudge fires once, and "Pick it up" opens a tab there |
| `node scripts/e2e-inbox.js` | The Projects inbox with a real throwaway repo: a merged branch and one with a commit nowhere else under Stale branches, Delete takes the merged one at once, Keep files the other away (still in git, still away after a refresh), and the pull-request half says how to turn it on |
| `node scripts/e2e-helpers.js [folder]` | A project's Helpers card and the port doctor in a throwaway repo, with the fake CLI: Before you start (a setting the example has and no .env does, Make .env from the example, a Node version that doesn't fit), a dev server on a port the script holds crashes and the card names who has it, Use :N instead brings it up there and remembers it, then Show me around (Ask first), When did this break? (refs checked, a copy) and Check the docs each wait unsent in the box, and Make it automatic… opens the routine editor without saving. Screenshots go in `[folder]` |
| `node scripts/e2e-github-workflows.js` | The CI-workflow permission toggle: present, gated on "Let Claude tasks push", never on by default, and the right wording in each state (a fake signed-in view, so no account or network) |
| `node scripts/e2e-friends.js` | Visiting crabs against a mock GitHub: asked first, a public calling card with only the look, a friend added by username, their crab on the desktop in their outfit, guestbook and souvenir, the Open House trophy, Peek at their tank (a hostile card's bits never drawn), his own tank on the card only once you choose and House Guest, waves both ways (strangers ignored), and the card deleted when it's turned off |
| `node scripts/e2e-github.js` | GitHub sign-in against a mock GitHub: the device code, only the chosen permissions, profile, the first sync into a private gist (his tank's layout included, its sharing left behind), publishing a pack as a pull request through the confirm window, Claude's git access (asked for separately, then present in new tasks), sign-out removes the encrypted token |
| `node scripts/e2e-sync.js` | Your friends list and settings following you between two PCs (two profiles, one mock GitHub): PC A's settings and friends reach a fresh PC B (the Settings view shows them, the friends' crabs are fetched, start at login stays A's), a change from another PC takes effect while B is open (mode, size, the open Settings view), and a friend B removes is gone from A too |
| `node scripts/e2e-plugin-card.js` | The plugin card (missing → Install button, installed → says so), an isolated copy on its own hook port with its marker, and the emoji + plain ASCII status files |
| `node scripts/e2e-forecast.js` | The usage forecast with backdated readings (SHELLBY_FORECAST_TEST): the composer warning and the meter, the setting, Ctrl+Shift+Enter holding a message (edit it back, drop it), then at the limit a held message and a held routine that both go by themselves at the reset |
| `node scripts/e2e-plain-cards.js` | Plain words with the fake CLI: a permission card says what the step does ("Delete 1 file or folder") and warns about a path outside the project, a plan card says its size, the Working bar says "Running your tests…" while they run, and with the setting off the cards use Claude Code's own names again |
| `node scripts/e2e-claude-tricks.js` | New tricks with the fake CLI and a changelog served locally (SHELLBY_CHANGELOG_URL): Shellby last saw an older Claude Code, the card lists what's new since (new features first, no fixes or other products), Try it puts a question in a new tab's box without sending it, Got it puts the card away for good, and with the setting off the changelog is never read |
| `node scripts/e2e-recap.js` | "While you were away" with fake idle readings: two hours away while one task finishes, one fails and one asks; the recap lists all three, a row opens its conversation, a 20-minute break or the setting turned off says nothing, and the usage block splits the window by conversation |
| `node scripts/e2e-team.js` | Team packs in throwaway repos: opening a repo with `.shellby/team.json` says so, Toolbox → Team lists it, Use these snippets makes `/ship` work there and only there, and Make a team pack writes the file (isolated profile) |
| `node scripts/e2e-statusline.js` | The status line: working, +XP and asking show up in the line; add it through the confirm window (isolated settings file), run the real statusLine command, remove restores the settings |
| `node scripts/e2e-xp.js` | XP and levels with the fake CLI and hook events: passing tests, a failing run (no XP), green again, git push, an outside deploy, desktop "+XP", level-up, Trophies card (next unlock, bounties, 30 days) |
| `node scripts/e2e-flaky.js` | The flaky test detective with the fake CLI: a Jest run piped through `tail` failing then passing on the same code, the Routines list, his "flaked 2 times this week" line, an edit between runs not counting, a click on the bubble, Fix it in a copy of the repository, and the Settings switch |
| `node scripts/e2e-bugdex.js` | The Bugdex with the fake CLI (commands replayed from `test/fixtures/bugdex/`): a failed command seen and on the loose with nothing paid, an edit and the same command passing caught (XP, the jar), the same bug soon after not counted twice, no catch for an unchanged tree, a deleted test or a grep through a log, the page, and the Settings switch |
| `node scripts/e2e-battle.js` | Bug battles with the fake CLI: a red suite opens a battle at full HP, a read is a Scout and an edit a Patch, a re-run with fewer failing tests takes HP off (the right tool counting double), a helper joins the party, and the green run knocks it out and jars it; the chip under the tabs and the battle screen show it. `SHELLBY_SHOTS=<folder>` saves screenshots |
| `node scripts/e2e-queue.js` | Queued messages with the fake CLI: queue behind a running turn, edit with ↑, drain in order, Stop hands them back, an error pauses the queue, a message queued while a tool runs is steered into the same turn (no Claude account needed) |
| `node scripts/e2e-context-debug.js [folder]` | @ context and Debug mode with the fake CLI: `@cha` lists another conversation above the files, picking it attaches a chip that opens and takes the `@word` out of the box, and sending puts it in the message fenced (not as a file); `/debug` gives a card, the receiver's address goes to Claude, lines posted to it show on the card as they arrive, Send, a second try, It's fixed, done, and the address closed after. Screenshots go in `[folder]` |
| `node scripts/e2e-routines.js` | Claude's other help with routines with the fake CLI: Describe it fills the editor, Fix with Claude on a failed routine opens a corrected one as an edit (nothing saved), and a request that needs a workflow is handed to the workflow builder |
| `node scripts/e2e-mcp.js` | MCP servers in workflows and routines, with the fake CLI and a fake MCP server in a throwaway home folder: the server list, reading its tools, an MCP tool step that runs and hands on its answer, the confirmation window naming what a step may use unasked, and the pickers in both editors |
| `node scripts/e2e-workflows.js` | Workflows with the fake CLI: typed Claude output steering an If, the confirmation window for risky saves, an Ask answered, Stop and Resume, a web hook on the local port |
| `node scripts/workflows-shots.js [dir]` | Screenshots of the Automate page (list, editor, a waiting run, a failed run) for a visual check |
| `node scripts/e2e-find-features.js` | Finding what's there: Settings search shows every tab at once cut down to the rows that match, opens a matching fold and closes it after, says when nothing matches, Esc brings the tabs back, and Ctrl+F on Settings lands in the box; then What you use counts each arrival at a screen (not Settings, not synced), leads with the most opened, lists what you haven't opened and Take a look goes there |
| `node scripts/e2e-history-done.js` | The Done tick in History: a ticked conversation leaves the default list, the Not done / Done / All tabs only appear once something is done, Undo puts it back, and sending a done conversation more work un-ticks it |
| `node scripts/e2e-crab-only.js` | A brand-new user picks "Just the crab": Health as home, chat hidden, Claude features become the upsell, survives a restart |
| `node scripts/e2e-work-mode.js` | A brand-new user with a lively crab picks Work mode: the Claude setup, a bar that leads with the tools, Work mode's quiet settings on show while the file keeps theirs, a pal added in Work mode kept as its own, his needs resting, and Ctrl+K → Leave Work mode putting everything back |
| `node scripts/e2e-card.js` | The crab card: Share, preview, a 1200×630 PNG in the test profile, the Show-Off trophy, junk bytes refused, his tank painted on it, and on the profile card only once you share it |
| `node scripts/e2e-tides.js [folder]` | Tide events with the day pinned inside The Haunting (`SHELLBY_TODAY`): the Us page's banner (countdown, goals, its bug and finds, the medal), the event bug out now in the Bugdex, its finds on the shelf, the sparkly reveal (odds, the keyboard on Share), the shiny and medal cards as 1200×630 PNGs, and the switch hiding it all. Screenshots go in `[folder]` |
| `node scripts/e2e-shellby-life.js` | Shellby's own life with the fake CLI and a mock GitHub: a level-up molts him into the Snail Shell (every beat, the Homes tab), petting, a throw that lands, an idle stroll, a focus session (helmet, countdown, XP, break), CI on a pull request going red, then fixed, then a review request, and a usage limit that's reached and then resets |
| `node scripts/e2e-beats.js` | How he moves between moods and how he works, fed real hook events: the crouch before work, thinking between tools, a pose and a held thing for each tool (scroll, pencil, wrench, magnifying glass, spyglass, checklist, a wave), the scuttle for a tool with no pose, every loop on him one framecap can read, a question that gets a claw tap after 20 s and a nod when answered, the breath after a turn, and a nap he nods off into in stages and wakes from eyes first |
| `node scripts/e2e-voice.js` | His voice and his little habits with the fake CLI: Quiet says nothing at all, Normal puts words in his bubble (and clears them), the bubble never clips or resizes his window, he remarks on a test run and a push, each idle habit plays, he keeps quiet on guard, a health warning outranks him, and he's the same crab after a restart |
| `node scripts/e2e-push-to-talk.js` | Push-to-talk, pressing the real hotkey through Windows with a recording in place of the microphone: the Settings switch, a tap still opens and closes the panel, a hold shows *listening…* and puts the words in the box after what's typed (not sent), and switched off a hold is just a tap |
| `node scripts/e2e-updates.js` | The update button with a scripted updater (`SHELLBY_FAKE_UPDATE=1`, `=fail` or `=current`): the download and its progress, "Restart and update" and the dot on the gear, the toast, the route the tray and the notification take, and a failed check offering another go |
| `node scripts/e2e-health.js` | Every health mood with scripted sensors: desktop reaction, speech bubble, Health view, the badge on Health in the bottom bar, screenshots |
| `node scripts/ui-regressions.js` | Closing the last tab leaves one tab; themed tooltips replace the OS ones; dragging a tab; keyboard only: switching tabs, the Ctrl+/ list, the palette's actions, where focus lands, Ctrl+W on a working tab |
| `node scripts/titlebar-fit.js` | Checks the title bar fits at every panel width in every permission mode |
| `node scripts/wardrobe-shots.js` | Screenshots the Outfits screen and the desktop crab in his current outfit, and reports renderer errors |
| `node scripts/idle-cost.js [seconds] [--unfocused \| --awake] [--closed]` | What he costs while doing nothing, per process: CPU as a share of one core, and resident memory. Run it before and after anything touching animation or timers (see the budget below) |
| `npm run perf` | The performance budget, ~4 min, run by CI as its own job: cold start, crab click to panel shown, Shellby's own share of the wait for Claude's first word, idle CPU (panel closed, and open behind a window) and memory, each held against `scripts/perf-budgets.js`. Prints a table, writes `perf-result.json` (CI keeps it as an artifact), and fails when a number is over budget twice running. `--only cold,latency,idle`, `--cold N`, `--samples N`, `--settle S`, `--idle S`, `--out file` |
| `node scripts/zorder-probe.js` | Shows where the running critter sits in the window stack and whether it's owned by the desktop |
| `node scripts/e2e-perch.js [dir]` | Perching against a real Notepad (needs a desktop, so not in CI): the hop up, ownership and click-through, riding a slow drag, shaken off dizzy, the window closing under him, the walk home, Hop down. Screenshots each beat. If a fullscreen window covers his screen, give him another: `SHELLBY_E2E_HOME=x,y` (DIPs) |
| `npx electron scripts/perch-probe.js` | The Win32 behaviour perching rests on: an owned window above a window of another process, surviving that window closing or crashing, hiding with it when it minimizes |
| `npm run screenshots` | Re-render the README screenshots (with fake account details) |
| `npm run reel` | Record the README demo GIF: a scripted task, helper crabs and a trophy, played through the real UI (needs Python + Pillow; `pip install imageio-ffmpeg` adds the MP4) |
| `python scripts/make-banners.py` | Compose the README banner and crab lineups from the crabs `npm run screenshots` just captured (needs Pillow) |
| `npm run icons` | Regenerate the app icons from the classic skin (needs Python + Pillow) |
| `npm run dist` | Build the NSIS installer and portable exe into `dist/` |
| `npm run release:cut -- X.Y.Z "Title"` | On main: the [change notes](../changes/README.md) into a CHANGELOG entry, the version bumped, one commit and a tag, nothing pushed. `--dry-run` shows the entry. Refuses until main is pushed and CI is green on it (`--wait` waits). Then `git push --atomic origin main vX.Y.Z` (CONTRIBUTING.md) |

## Keeping up with Claude Code

Claude Code ships often, and Shellby drives it through flags and a protocol that can change under it. So every night `.github/workflows/cli-compat.yml` installs the newest `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` and runs `scripts/cli-compat.js` against it:

- **Flags.** Every flag `ClaudeSession.buildArgs()` can launch with is listed in `src/main/cli-contract.js`, and a unit test fails if the two drift apart. The documented ones must be in `claude --help`. Two (`--permission-prompt-tool`, `--resume-session-at`) are hidden from it, so the check also launches with every flag at once and fails on `unknown option`.
- **Values.** Each `--permission-mode` Shellby's modes map to, and each `--effort` level, must be accepted (and a made-up one refused, or the check can't tell). Ask mode launches as `default`, which `--help` no longer lists but the CLI still takes.
- **Protocol.** The `initialize` control request, with the same hook registration Shellby sends, must be answered. It is answered before sign-in, so this needs no account.
- **A real turn**, only when the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` repository secret is set: one Haiku turn writes a file through an approved permission prompt, and every event it sends must be one `stream.js` understands. `KNOWN` in `stream.js` lists the events Shellby knows, including the ones it reads past on purpose; an event outside it is reported, and the transcript is kept as a run artifact.

A pass updates the **Works with Claude Code** badge in the README (a shields.io endpoint, `cli-compat.json` on the `badges` branch, which the workflow creates on its first run). A failure turns the badge red with the last version that worked, and opens an issue labelled `cli-compat`, or comments on the open one once per new version. The next pass closes it.

The app watches too: a top-level event type Shellby has never seen is written to the log once per run (`session.js`), so a "Report a problem" paste says what a Claude Code update added.

`test/fixtures/cli-transcripts/` holds real transcripts, scrubbed of paths, names, ids and per-user setup, and a unit test audits them on every CI run. To record one for a new version, on a signed-in machine (one tiny Haiku turn):

```
node scripts/cli-compat.js --real --transcript test/fixtures/cli-transcripts/<version>.jsonl
```

Read it before committing it.

### Slash commands

The <kbd>/</kbd> menu lists Claude Code's own commands from `src/main/cli-commands.js`, a catalogue that says for each one how Shellby handles it: `cli` (sent as it is, it works in print mode), `shellby` (opens Shellby's screen for it, `src/renderer/panel/builtin-commands.js`) or `terminal` (it only works in Claude Code's terminal: he says why and offers **Open in a terminal**). It follows the live CLI on its own: a command a conversation's init lists that the catalogue doesn't know goes through to Claude Code as it is (`toolbox.js` `mergeInit`), and a `cli` one the init stops listing is hidden. When print mode answers a command with "isn't available in this environment" or "Unknown command", `stream.js` adds a plain-words reply (`headlessReply`).

To keep the catalogue itself current, `npm run commands:check` reads the command definitions out of the installed CLI (the native `claude.exe` or an npm `cli.js`; there's no flag that lists them, and an init costs a message) and lists what's new and what's gone. Add new ones to the catalogue with a handling, then `npm run commands:check -- --write` to record the list: `test/cli-commands.test.js` fails while the catalogue and `test/fixtures/cli-commands.json` differ. A name the scan finds that isn't a command (a bundled skill, say) goes in `NOT_COMMANDS` in `scripts/commands-check.js`.



## What he costs when idle

He is on the wallpaper all day, so this is the number that decides whether a
laptop user keeps him. Measure with `node scripts/idle-cost.js`, which reports a
share of **one core** (so 100% is one core saturated). `--closed` never opens
the panel; `--awake` keeps him and the panel as if focused and uncovered
(`SHELLBY_IDLE_AWAKE`) without taking focus from anything, so it's safe with a
game up. Never `--unfocused` while someone is playing: it starts Notepad in front.

Ryzen 9 3950X, October 2026 (all processes added up, no debugger, medians of
interleaved runs on a shared, busy desktop: expect ±1 point):

| State | CPU | Resident |
|---|---|---|
| Panel closed, crab visible, the October bats (default) | ~1.6–2.1% (GPU process 0.7–1.4, main 0.3, crab 0.1–0.3) | ~495 MB |
| Panel open behind your windows, no outfit | ~0.5–0.8% (crab and panel both calm or covered) | ~490 MB |
| Panel open and focused | ~4% (the panel's drifting light ticks at 12 fps) | ~500 MB |
| Nobody at the desk for 5 minutes (any outfit) | ~0.1% | ~490 MB |

Memory: Chromium's network service used to be a process of its own, ~53 MB
resident for the handful of requests he makes. It runs inside main now
(src/main/lighter.js; `SHELLBY_NETWORK_PROCESS=1` puts it back to compare):
`idle-cost.js 30 --closed` went from 5 processes and ~537 MB to 4 and
~485–513 MB, main growing by a few MB. `--js-flags=--optimize-for-size` was
tried too and changed nothing.

The first row was ~3.4–4.2% before the bats flew in flights and the idle went
to pixel-art frames (interleaved with the same build minus those, same hour).
Of what's left, about half is his idle (about 1.4 frames a second: the breathe,
his blinks and glances, the snap) and half is life: a habit (dig, polish, peek...) about once
a minute at 12 fps for two or three seconds, a stroll, and a bat flight every
three minutes. Under 1% would mean fewer of those, which is a call about how
alive he looks rather than a fix. `--unfocused` on a busy desktop may leave the
panel focused (Notepad doesn't always get the foreground): if the panel's body
has no `calm` class, you measured the focused row.

Before this round (0.71.0) the crab alone was ~7% and a panel opened behind
your windows ~3.8%; the 37% / 75% of earlier releases went with the 12 fps
frame clock. Not counted above, because they aren't electron.exe: every
child process he starts. Until 0.71 that was `reg.exe` every 20 s (~330 ms of
CPU each, the microphone check) and `nvidia-smi` every 5 s (~50 ms each), about
2.6% of a core between them; now the registry is read in place and nvidia-smi
runs every 15 s while all is well and the panel is closed (~0.35%).

Where the rest goes: nearly all of it is the GPU process presenting frames of
the transparent crab window, roughly 0.5% of a core per frame per second. So
the work is in drawing fewer frames, not cheaper ones:

- **shared/framecap.js** ticks 12 times a second but only moves an animation
  when that tick changes the picture (it reads the keyframes once). A loop that
  eases the whole way round (the bats' orbit, a working hop) still draws every
  tick; one that steps (the idle breathe, blink and claw snap) draws a few
  frames a cycle. Prefer `steps()` for anything that runs all day. A step at
  the start of a hold changes nothing, so `steps(n)` (jump-end) isn't moved there.
- **It can only skip what it can read.** A keyframe list with no 0% or 100%,
  or `steps(n)` applied across many intervals, and it moves the animation every
  tick. `leg` and `snap` had no 100% and the working "..." in his bubble jumped
  sixteen times a lap, so the scuttle drew all 12 frames a second.
  e2e-beats checks that every loop on him is readable.
- **The work beat.** Everything he does while he works (the scuttle, every
  .work-<pose> in critter.css, the helpers, the "...") steps on 166 ms, a hair under
  two ticks. Steps of different loops then fall on the same ticks, so the
  scuttle draws 6 frames a second where it drew 12, and the poses 2 to 6
  (reading is 2). Exactly a sixth of a second splits them: some steps land
  just after a tick and move one late.
- **His idle eyes** run on 24 s with uneven blinks and a glance each way, about
  1.4 frames a second for all of his idle where the fixed 6 s blink made 1.1:
  the price of not looking like a metronome.
- **Particle effects** (the seasonal bats are on by default in October) cost
  ~2 points while they play, so on the crab's window they come in flights
  (effects.js `FLIGHT`: 8 s every 3 min, fading in and out) and the particles
  are removed in between. Previews (the wardrobe, the OBS overlay) play them
  all the time. A particle's path is held in whole art pixels for whole ticks
  of the 12 fps clock (step-eased Web Animations, effects.js `plan`), so the
  frame clock only presents a frame when one of them actually moves. They stop with everything else when he's covered, the screen
  is locked, or nobody is at the desk.
- **The window in front** is read once for the game and cover checks
  (front-poll.js): its exe is kept while it stays in front, and the poll goes
  from 2 s to 5 s after half a minute without a change.
- **Away**: no key or mouse for five minutes (`powerMonitor.getSystemIdleTime`,
  in the front poll in wiring/windows.js) is treated like being covered.
  Isolated dev and test runs never count as away unless `SHELLBY_AWAY_S` is set.

The `calm` and `calm-deep` classes (see panel.css and `watchIdleCost` in wiring/windows.js)
drop the decorative animations when the panel isn't focused, and everything when
the screen is locked. Two findings worth keeping if you touch this:

- **`animation-play-state: paused` saves nothing.** A paused animation keeps its
  compositing alive and costs the same as a running one. Only `animation: none`
  (or removing the element) frees the work.
- **Never measure with a debugger attached.** `--remote-debugging-port` keeps the
  renderer and compositor awake; it turns 1% into 80% and will send you chasing
  the wrong thing.

- **Calm has to survive a repaint.** critter.js rebuilds the body's classes on
  every state push, so `calm-deep` is part of that list (`stillNow`), not a
  class toggled on the side.

Redrawing the sprite as a canvas or pre-rendered frames was the plan here, but
the SVG isn't what costs: the renderer is ~0.1–0.5% of a core, and the price is
per presented frame, whatever draws it. Fewer frames was the win.

### The budget CI holds him to

`npm run perf` (scripts/perf-budget.js) measures the numbers above, and a few
more, on every push to main and every pull request, with an isolated profile and the fake Claude CLI. The
budgets are in `scripts/perf-budgets.js`, each with a comment saying where the
number comes from:

| Metric | Budget | Local (Ryzen 9 3950X, busy desktop) |
|---|---|---|
| Cold start to the crab painted | 8 s | 0.8–1.6 s |
| Cold start to the panel booted | 10 s | 1.1–1.5 s |
| Crab clicked to the panel shown and painted | 500 ms | ~20 ms (the very first open, ~1.2 s, is reported but not judged) |
| Shellby's share of the wait for Claude's first word | 600 ms | ~90 ms |
| Idle CPU, panel closed | 25% of a core | 1.5–5% (more with a particle outfit on) |
| Idle CPU, panel open behind a window | 60% of a core | 0.5–6% (the same) |
| Memory, panel closed / open | 900 / 1000 MB | ~500 MB |

They're loose on purpose: CI's runners have a few slow cores, no GPU and reduced
motion on, so they read several times slower than a desktop and vary between
runs. They catch a number that doubles, not one that creeps. Over a budget by up
to 15% prints a warning; past that the phase is measured once more, and the job
fails only if it's over again. Each run's `perf-result.json` artifact holds every
sample, so once a few runs show where the runner really sits, tighten the budgets
towards 1.5x that.

How each is measured, briefly (the header of perf-budget.js has the rest):

- **Cold start** is from spawning electron.exe to the `shellby:crab-painted` and
  `shellby:panel-ready` performance marks (critter.js, boot.js), read over CDP.
  The script's clock and the renderers' `performance.timeOrigin` are both the
  system clock, so the times line up.
- **First-token overhead** is Enter to the reply painted in the feed, minus the
  fake CLI's scripted 100 ms. Today most of it is the snapshot of the folder that
  `beginTurn` (wiring/sessions.js) takes before the message goes out, for the
  turn's diff.
- **Idle CPU and memory** use idle-cost.js's method (scripts/process-tree.js, now
  shared by both) in two launches with **no** debugger attached, for the reason
  above. The panel-closed launch uses a profile that has done onboarding; the
  open one is a fresh profile, focused, then Notepad takes focus.

Health shows the same thing to the person running him: **Shellby himself: 1% CPU,
450 MB** above the hogs list (health/footprint.js, from `app.getAppMetrics()`'s
`cumulativeCPUUsage`, since its `percentCPUUsage` is reset by anybody's call).

## Project layout

```
src/main/        Electron main process
  main.js          `shared` (the state every area reads and changes), the order areas are
                   wired in, and boot; nothing else. `share(wireX(shared))` adds an area's
                   exports to shared and stops boot if two areas give the same name
  wiring/          one module per area of the app: `wireX(shared)` returns its functions,
                   which only run once boot calls them. Besides windows, critter, sessions,
                   progress, timetrack, toolbox, github, tray and the rest:

  mention-context.js @ what Shellby knows (pure): a dev server, a red build, another chat or a note, ranked for the @ menu and
                   fenced as a block; wiring/mention-context.js lists a tab's own, saves a pick's snapshot and reads it back for composePrompt
  debug-mode.js    Debug mode (pure): the prompts, a reproduction's lines, the marked lines left behind; debug-ingest.js is the
                   127.0.0.1 receiver the logging posts to; wiring/debug-mode.js runs the rounds and the card

  desktop-layer.js keeps the critter on the wallpaper layer (koffi → user32)
  claude/          Claude Code itself: cli.js finds the CLI, checks auth, scrubs billing env vars; setup.js (its hooks and CLAUDE.md files); tricks.js (what's
                   new in its changelog); update.js keeps the CLI itself current: the daily registry check, `claude update` on request or by itself while idle, tell | auto | off (fetch and run are injected; wiring/claude-updates.js)

  weather.js       the weather; weather/service.js fetches it
  hooks/           Toolbox → Hooks: draft.js (Ask Claude for one), recipes.js (ready-made ones), test.js (Test run)
  history.js       local conversation index + transcripts
  log.js           the log behind "Report a problem" (scrubbed of paths and tokens)
  trouble.js       a failed turn in one sentence and the button for the next step (pure); the raw words go to the log
  skins.js         loads and validates skins
  config.js        settings in %APPDATA%\Shellby\settings.json
  workmode.js      Work mode (pure): the settings it lays over yours, where a change made in it is kept, and what else it quiets
  placement.js     pure geometry for placing the critter and panel across monitors
  capture.js       `npm run screenshots`; reel.js records the README demo
src/preload/     the only bridge between sandboxed renderers and main
src/renderer/    critter + panel UIs (plain HTML/CSS/JS, no framework)
  critter/         the desktop crab: critter.js (moods, bubble, how he works: src/main/work-pose.js picks the pose) · signs.js (the CI, server and call signs, and tossing his held item for them) · stickers.js (a new sticker slapped on, XP floats, surprises) · crew.js (helpers beside him, a visiting friend and what they do together) · motion.js (flying, walking, perching, climbing, idle habits); the four share critter.js's top-level scope as classic scripts loaded right after it · beats.js (the beats between moods, nodding off and waking, a question left waiting) · sound.js (the WebAudio engine: volume, footsteps, bumps, ta-das) · chirp.js (his voice) · ambient.js (surf, rock pool); none use audio files, and main decides what may play (src/main/sounds.js)
  shared/todos.js  Claude's own to-do list folded from a conversation's items (pure; main and the panel both use it)
  panel/           core · shortcuts (every key, the palette's ranking; pure) · nav (bottom bar, Ctrl+K, Ctrl+/) · files (file links, an edit's diff, zoom) · find (Ctrl+F) · feed (crew lanes) · feed-native (messages between agents, skills, memories, the plan card) · native-strip (the to-do list and background tray above the box) · toolbox-automemory · routines-cloud · tabs · tab-panes (split panes, each with its own tab strip, and pop-outs) · pane-room (room for the panes, and growing the panel to make it) · notes · bugdex · bugdex-battle · toolbox · shop · routines · workflows · settings · wardrobe · xp · streaks · health · card · moment-card (one 1200×630 card per moment) · sparkle (the sparkly reveal) · tide (tide events) · social (swaps and eggs) · celebrate · crabonly · workmode · outfitcode · github · boot · tank (the Tank tab) with tank-render (the words and controls around the glass, drawn from what tank.js passes in)
                   its page, panel.html, is built from html/: frame.html (head, title bar, menus, bar, sheets, scripts) plus a file per screen (chat.html, projects.html, settings.html with a file per tab…). Edit those and run `npm run panel:html`; the built file is committed, and test/panel-html.test.js fails when it's stale
                   a big screen is a file per part (tab-strip, tab-send, feed-asks, settings-account, health-gauges…), and its words and decisions live in a pure module beside it with node:test coverage (tab-logic, feed-logic, settings-text, health-logic, projects-logic, tab-sort)
  shared/          used by more than one window or by tests too: sprite (him and any pixel grid as SVG, each part in its
                   own animatable group with its ink line inside it, drawn only on cells nothing else fills), framecap, workposes (what he holds for each work pose, and how long a pose stays up; the OBS overlay uses it too), diff (an edit's red and green lines), panes (the split grid, its sizes and a saved layout; pure)
src/skins/       built-in skins (JSON pixel grids)
src/wardrobe/    the built-in wardrobe pack (same format as community packs)
src/streamdeck/  the Stream Deck plugin (Node 24, no packages): Stream Deck's websocket on one side, deck.js on the other, keys drawn as SVG
test/            node:test suites and a fake Claude CLI
claude-plugin/   the Shellby plugin for Claude Code (hooks that report sessions to the app)
```
